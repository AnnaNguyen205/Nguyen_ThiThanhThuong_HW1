**Main dishes**

For me, the main dishes of Vietnamese cuisine are incredibly diverse, so I have a lot of choices, among which there are three special dishes that I would like to share with everyone

1. Pho dat biet - Special Pho : Special combination beef rice noodle soup with rare and brisket beef, beef balls and stripe

**Notice** 

These dishes should be accompanied by fresh vegetables, especially those with broth like Pho and Bun Bo Hue, along with special sauces for each dish such as hoisin sauce, fish sauce. Additionally, you can add chili if you want to enhance a bit of spicy flavor.
